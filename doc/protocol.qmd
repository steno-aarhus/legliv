## Description

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)-related primary liver cancer
is on the rise worldwide. Preventive interventions are critical. NAFLD
risk factors include sedentary lifestyles and "Western"-style diets high
in fat and red meat. Legumes are now promoted in the Danish dietary
guidelines as they have a low climate impact and are a good plant-based
source of protein. They may additionally have anti-carcinogenic
properties. Pre-clinical studies suggest that legumes are a promising
intervention to lower risk of liver cancer. This project will use
prospective data from the UK Biobank cohort as no Danish cohort consumes
enough legumes to investigate. Based on a food substitution model,
hazard ratios for liver cancer when substituting red meats with legumes
will be estimated. It is critical that we reduce the climate impact of
our diet. This study will add new knowledge that can qualify the health
arguments behind the Danish dietary guideline to eat more legumes and
less meat. ::: content-hidden Overall description of your project. Think

## Objectives and hypotheses

### Introduction

Food systems are estimated to cause 40% of man-made greenhouse gas
emissions, and the foodstuff with the highest carbon footprint by far is
red meat, particularly beef. The average adult Dane consumes \~900g/week
red meat. Thus to reduce climate impacts of diet, the 2021 Danish
dietary guidelines recommend eating less meat while increasing intake of
legumes to \~100 g/day precooked legumes. Different species of legumes
are traditional staple foods in many countries; in Denmark, however,
consumption of legumes is very low. There may be great potential for
downstream population health benefits of increasing legume consumption,
particularly for diseases related to obesity, of which non-alcoholic
fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and its sequalae primary liver cancer are of
growing public health importance. Emerging evidence indicates that
legumes may have anti-cancer effects. However, because studies on
primary liver cancer to date have assessed consumption of legumes
instead of any other food in relation to health outcomes, little is
known of the associations at the expense of specifically red meat.

### Objective

To investigate the association between statistical replacement of red
meat with legumes and incidence of primary liver cancer, as well as
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma
(IH-CCA) separately, and whether the association is mediated by NAFLD.

### Hypotheses

1.  Substitution of red and processed meats with legumes is associated
    with a lower risk of HCC and IH-CCA.
2.  The association between substitution of red and processed meats with
    legumes and risk of HCC and IH-CCA is mediated through NAFLD.

# Design plan

## Study type

::: content-hidden
Note: Leave the below text here.
:::

**Observational Study**. Data is collected from study subjects that are
not randomly assigned to a treatment. This includes surveys, natural
experiments, and regression discontinuity designs.

## Blinding

::: content-hidden
Note: Leave the below text here.
:::

No blinding is involved in this study.

## Study design

This will be an observational follow-up cohort study. Because no Danish
study populations consume enough legumes to investigate associations
with disease, we will use data from the UK Biobank, a prospective cohort
with health information on approximately 500,000 participants, aged
40-69 at baseline, living in the UK. Participants were recruited between
2006 and 2010. Dietary data on legumes were collected by multiple 24hr
recalls in 176,000 participants. The exposures in this study will be red
meat intake (total, processed and unprocessed) and legume intake. Legume
and red meat intake will be estimated on the reported number of servings
consumed, measured in g/day. Incident primary liver cancer diagnoses
during follow-up are determined through ICD-10 codes C22.0 (Liver cell
carcinoma) and C22.1 (Intrahepatic bile duct carcinoma) in the National
Health Services (NHS) registries. Baseline covariate data are by
self-report or measured at the recruitment clinic visit.

Describe your study design. Typical study designs for observation
studies include cohort, cross sectional, and case-control studies

This question has a variety of possible answers. The key is for a
researcher to be as detailed as is necessary given the specifics of
their design. Be careful to determine if every parameter has been
specified in the description of the study design. There may be some
overlap between this question and the following questions. That is OK,
as long as sufficient detail is given in one of the areas to provide all
of the requested information.

Put in overall information about the study design. Key elements of the
study design, the location, relevant dates, periods of recruitment etc.
For instance, include that it is a cohort and cross-sectional (most
likely).

# Sampling plan

## Existing data

::: content-hidden
Note: Leave the below text here.
:::

**Registration prior to analysis of the data**. As of the date of
submission, the data exist and you have accessed it, though no analysis
has been conducted related to the research plan (including calculation
of summary statistics). A common situation for this scenario when a
large dataset exists that is used for many different studies over time,
or when a data set is randomly split into a sample for exploratory
analyses, and the other section of data is reserved for later
confirmatory data analysis.

## Explanation of existing data

::: content-hidden
Note: Leave the below text here.
:::

The UK Biobank is a large national cohort of participants in the UK,
with data collected in a standardized format the the sole purpose of
providing a data resource for researchers to use for health research.
All information about collection procedures, limitations, and sources of
bias are well established and described by the UK Biobank resource.

Because of its size of data collected, it is near impossible to a priori
see patterns in the data that might influence how the analysis will be
conducted, unless specifically looked for or previously published on. In
this way, we feel pre-analysis bias is minimal.

## Data collection procedures

::: content-hidden
-   If relevant, describe if or how the subset of data was selected or
    chosen participant
-   Describe how the exposure was assessed (or refer to the UK Biobank
    link on it)
-   Describe how the outcome was assessed (or refer to the UK Biobank
    link on it)
-   Describe how the covariates were assessed (or refer to the UK
    Biobank link on it)
:::

### Exposure

Detailed dietary data were collected with a self-assessed, web-based
24-hour recall dietary assessment tool, Oxford WebQ. A questionnaire was
added at the assessment visit at the end of recruitment. After
recruitment, four additional rounds of online questionnaires were
conducted online at 3-4 monthly intervals. Participants were asked to
recall what they ate the previous day \[50\]. More than 200,000 UK
Biobank participants completed ≥1 Oxford WebQ \[51\]. More than 80,000
participants completed ≥3 Oxford WebQ \[52\]. Dietary data on legumes
were collected in 176,000 participants. The exposures in this study will
be red meat intake (total, processed and unprocessed) and legume intake.
Legume and red meat intake will be estimated on the reported number of
servings consumed, measured in grams/day. Participants who reported
consuming vegetables were asked to report the intake of beans (not
greens) and lentils they had the day before. Participants who reported
consuming meat or poultry were asked to report the intake of different
meats they had the day before. This British cohort was chosen as legume
consumption is higher in the UK than in Denmark. \[53\]

### Outcome

The primary outcomes will be HCC and IH-CCA. Cancer diagnoses will be
assessed through linkage to NHS Digital and Public Health England, and
the NHS Central Register. Incident primary liver cancer diagnoses during
follow-up are determined through ICD-10 codes C22.0 (Liver cell
carcinoma) and C22.1 (Intrahepatic bile duct carcinoma) in the National
Health Services (NHS) registries.

### Covariates

Based on a literature review of studies regarding causes of liver
cancer, important covariables will be selected a priori and visualized
by a directed acyclic graph (DAG). Covariables will most likely include
total caloric intake, age, sex, socioeconomic status, BMI, smoking
status, physical activity, alcohol intake, history of chronic liver
disease, liver cancer, viral hepatitis, cholelithiasis, and diabetes.
Collection of data on socioeconomic status, lifestyle habits and
biomedical and anthropometric measures was conducted as aforementioned.

## Statistical models

::: content-hidden
Describe your statistical analysis. This is essentially your statistical
analysis plan.

Remember to mention statistical software to be used, analysis of
baseline characteristics, adjustment for confounding, selection of
potential confounders, examined subgroups, how missing data was handled,
how loss to follow-up was addressed and sensitivity analyses.
:::

Multivariable-adjusted Cox proportional hazards regression model will be
used to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) with corresponding 95% confidence
intervals for liver cancer when substituting red meats with legumes.
Substitution will be done in two ways:

1.  Equal-mass substitution, i.e., substituting x grams of red meats
    with x grams of legumes.

2.  Equal-calorie substitution, i.e., substitution x calories from red
    meats with x calories from legumes.

Different adjustment levels will be added to the substitution models.
Model 1 will be minimally adjusted for age, sex, total caloric intake,
and other dietary components other than the substituted foods. When
substituting grams of legumes, the unit for all dietary components will
be grams/day. When substituting calories of legumes, the unit for all
dietary components will be calories/day. Model 2 will be further
adjusted for socioeconomic status, ethnic group, BMI, waist
circumference, physical activity, smoking status, alcohol intake, and
history of chronic liver disease, liver cancer, viral hepatitis,
cholelithiasis, and diabetes, as determined by the DAG.

A secondary analysis based on the pseudo-observational method will be
used to estimate absolute risk differences (RD) \[55\]. The analysis
will be modelled as in the main analyses. Causal mediation analysis will
be used for hypothesis 2, so that potential mediator-outcome confounding
can be taken into account \[56\]. All analyses will be conducted in R
with a significance level of 5%.

Estimated study power based on detecting a HR=0.72 between highest and
lowest legume consumption as in ref. 32 and primary liver cancer (event
probability 0.0024) in 176,000 UKB participants ranges 67-81%, depending
on assumed SD and correlations.

## Transformations

::: content-hidden
Describe any transformations you will make to the data, such as
centering, recoding, etc. This will likely change during the actual
analysis, but at least here you can give a general idea for what you
will do to the data.
:::

## Inference criteria

::: content-hidden
Describe how you will infer that a result is meaningful or not. For
instance, if using p-values, indicate what the threshold is and WHY.
Also what steps you are taking to minimize misclassification/false
discovery rate.
:::

## Data exclusion

::: content-hidden
Describe what data you will exclude and why. For instance, dropping type
1 diabetes since you are only looking at type 2 diabetes. Or how you
will handle outliers.
:::

## Missing data

::: content-hidden
Describe how you will handle missing or incomplete data. This will
likely change when you actually do your analysis, but its a good first
step.
:::

## Exploratory analyses (optional)

::: content-hidden
Describe any exploratory analyses you will do and that you might report
on/include in the manuscript. Exploratory analysis is on where you have
not made a hypothesis or prediction about, and instead are seeing what
patterns or associations might exist. This could be to help you in your
main analysis or it could be the main aim of your project.
