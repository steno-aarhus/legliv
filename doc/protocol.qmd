## Description

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)-related primary liver cancer
is on the rise worldwide. Preventive interventions are critical. NAFLD
risk factors include sedentary lifestyles and "Western"-style diets high
in fat and red meat. Legumes are now promoted in the Danish dietary
guidelines as they have a low climate impact and are a good plant-based
source of protein. They may additionally have anti-carcinogenic
properties. Pre-clinical studies suggest that legumes are a promising
intervention to lower risk of liver cancer. This project will use
prospective data from the UK Biobank cohort as no Danish cohort consumes
enough legumes to investigate. Based on a food substitution model,
hazard ratios for liver cancer when substituting red meats with legumes
will be estimated. It is critical that we reduce the climate impact of
our diet. This study will add new knowledge that can qualify the health
arguments behind the Danish dietary guideline to eat more legumes and
less meat. ::: content-hidden Overall description of your project. Think

## Objectives and hypotheses

### Introduction

Food systems are estimated to cause 40% of man-made greenhouse gas
emissions, and the foodstuff with the highest carbon footprint by far is
red meat, particularly beef. The average adult Dane consumes \~900g/week
red meat. Thus to reduce climate impacts of diet, the 2021 Danish
dietary guidelines recommend eating less meat while increasing intake of
legumes to \~100 g/day precooked legumes. Different species of legumes
are traditional staple foods in many countries; in Denmark, however,
consumption of legumes is very low. There may be great potential for
downstream population health benefits of increasing legume consumption,
particularly for diseases related to obesity, of which non-alcoholic
fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and its sequalae primary liver cancer are of
growing public health importance. Emerging evidence indicates that
legumes may have anti-cancer effects. However, because studies on
primary liver cancer to date have assessed consumption of legumes
instead of any other food in relation to health outcomes, little is
known of the associations at the expense of specifically red meat.

### Objective

To investigate the association between statistical replacement of red
meat with legumes and incidence of primary liver cancer (hepatocellular
carcinoma (HCC) and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (IH-CCA)), and
whether the association is mediated by NAFLD.

### Hypotheses

1.  Substitution of red meat (processed and unprocessed) with legumes is
    associated with a lower risk liver cancer.

2.  The association between substitution of red meat (processed and
    unprocessed) with legumes and risk of liver cancer is mediated
    through NAFLD.

3.  A higher intake of legumes is associated with a lower risk of liver
    cancer.

# Design plan

## Study type

::: content-hidden
Note: Leave the below text here.
:::

**Observational Study**. Data is collected from study subjects that are
not randomly assigned to a treatment. This includes surveys, natural
experiments, and regression discontinuity designs.

## Blinding

::: content-hidden
Note: Leave the below text here.
:::

No blinding is involved in this study.

## Study design

This will be an observational follow-up cohort study. Because no Danish
study populations consume enough legumes to investigate associations
with disease, we will use data from the UK Biobank, a prospective cohort
with health information on approximately 500,000 participants, aged
40-69 at baseline, living in the UK. Participants were recruited between
2006 and 2010. Dietary data on legumes were collected by multiple 24hr
recalls in 176,000 participants. The exposures in this study will be red
meat intake (total, processed and unprocessed) and legume intake. Legume
and red meat intake will be estimated on the reported number of servings
consumed, measured in g/day. Incident primary liver cancer diagnoses
during follow-up are determined through ICD-10 codes C22.0 (Liver cell
carcinoma) and C22.1 (Intrahepatic bile duct carcinoma) in the National
Health Services (NHS) registries. Baseline covariate data are by
self-report or measured at the recruitment clinic visit.

Describe your study design. Typical study designs for observation
studies include cohort, cross sectional, and case-control studies

This question has a variety of possible answers. The key is for a
researcher to be as detailed as is necessary given the specifics of
their design. Be careful to determine if every parameter has been
specified in the description of the study design. There may be some
overlap between this question and the following questions. That is OK,
as long as sufficient detail is given in one of the areas to provide all
of the requested information.

Put in overall information about the study design. Key elements of the
study design, the location, relevant dates, periods of recruitment etc.
For instance, include that it is a cohort and cross-sectional (most
likely).

# Sampling plan

## Existing data

::: content-hidden
Note: Leave the below text here.
:::

**Registration prior to analysis of the data**. As of the date of
submission, the data exist and you have accessed it, though no analysis
has been conducted related to the research plan (including calculation
of summary statistics). A common situation for this scenario when a
large dataset exists that is used for many different studies over time,
or when a data set is randomly split into a sample for exploratory
analyses, and the other section of data is reserved for later
confirmatory data analysis.

## Explanation of existing data

::: content-hidden
Note: Leave the below text here.
:::

The UK Biobank is a large national cohort of participants in the UK,
with data collected in a standardized format the the sole purpose of
providing a data resource for researchers to use for health research.
All information about collection procedures, limitations, and sources of
bias are well established and described by the UK Biobank resource.

Because of its size of data collected, it is near impossible to a priori
see patterns in the data that might influence how the analysis will be
conducted, unless specifically looked for or previously published on. In
this way, we feel pre-analysis bias is minimal.

### Exposure

This British cohort was chosen as legume consumption is higher in the UK
than in Denmark. \[7\] Detailed dietary data were collected with a
self-assessed, web-based 24-hour recall dietary assessment tool, Oxford
WebQ. A questionnaire was added to the assessment visit at the end of
recruitmen[\[NB1\]](#_msocom_1) t. After recruitment, four additional
rounds of online questionnaires were conducted online at 3-4 monthly
intervals. Participants were asked to recall what they ate the previous
day \[8\]. More than 200,000 UK Biobank participants completed ≥1 Oxford
WebQ \[9\]. More than 80,000 participants completed ≥3 Oxford WebQ
\[10\].  Participants who completed ≥2 Oxford WebQ's are included in
this study. Dietary data on legumes were collected in 176,000
participants.

The exposures in this study will be red meat intake (total, processed
and unprocessed) and legume intake. Legume and red meat intake will be
estimated on the reported number of servings consumed, measured in
grams/day. Participants who reported consuming vegetables were asked to
report the intake of beans (not greens) and lentils they had the day
before. Participants who reported consuming meat or poultry were asked
to report the intake of different meats they had the day before.

Data from the UK Nutrient Databank Food Composition Tables were used to
calculate total energy and nutrient intake by multiplying the number of
portions consumed by the set quantity of each food portion size and its
nutrient composition \[7\].

### Outcome

The primary outcome is liver cancer defined as either HCC or IH-CCA.
Cancer diagnoses will be assessed through linkage to NHS Digital and
Public Health England, and the NHS Central Register. Incident primary
liver cancer diagnoses during follow-up are determined through ICD-10
codes C22.0 (Liver cell carcinoma) and C22.1 (Intrahepatic bile duct
carcinoma) in the National Health Services (NHS) registries.

### Covariates

Covariables are detected a priori from studies assessing diet components
as exposure and liver cancer as the outcome \[11\] and illustrated using
directed acyclic graphs (fig. 1.). Information on covariables will
include all other dietary components (\[g/day\] or \[kcal/day\]), age
(years), sex (male, female), socioeconomic status (educational level,
Townsend Deprivation Score \[quintiles\], living with a spouse (yes,
no), and geographical location), ethnicity (white, Mixed, Asian, black,
other, unknown), anthropometry (BMI \[kg/m2\], waist circumference
\[cm\]), alcohol consumption, physical activity (low \[0-9.9
METs/week\], moderate \[10-49.9 METs/week\], and high \[≥50 METs/week\],
unknown), smoking status (never, former, current 1-15 cigarettes per
day, current ≥15 cigarettes per day, current but number of cigarettes
per day unknown, and smoking status unknown), and self-reported \[yes,
no, unknown\] own or family members' diagnoses of diabetes, and history
of other liver diseases (cholelithiasis, cholecystectomy). All
covariables will be baseline measures except dietary components.

## Statistical models

::: content-hidden
Describe your statistical analysis. This is essentially your statistical
analysis plan.

Remember to mention statistical software to be used, analysis of
baseline characteristics, adjustment for confounding, selection of
potential confounders, examined subgroups, how missing data was handled,
how loss to follow-up was addressed and sensitivity analyses.
:::

Multivariable-adjusted Cox proportional hazards regression model will be
used to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) with corresponding 95% confidence
intervals for liver cancer when substituting red meats with legumes.
Substitution will be done in two ways \[12\]:

1.  Equal-mass substitution, i.e., substituting x grams of red meats
    with x grams of legumes.
2.  Equal-calorie substitution, i.e., substitution x calories from red
    meats with x calories from legumes.

Estimates will be presented for total red meat as well as stratified
estimates of processed and unprocessed red meat. Age will be used as the
underlying timescale. Follow-up time will start at participants' last
completed Oxford WebQ. Participants will be right censured due to one of
the following events, whichever comes first: most recent registry date
for the full follow-up for the outcomes, date of death, date of liver
cancer diagnosis, or loss to follow-up.

Different adjustment levels will be added to the substitution models.
Model 1 will be minimally adjusted for age at recruitment, sex, total
caloric intake, and other dietary components other than the substituted
foods. When substituting grams of legumes, the unit for all dietary
components will be grams/day. When substituting calories of legumes, the
unit for all dietary components will be calories/day. Model 2 will be
further adjusted for educational level, Townsend Deprivation Score,
ethnicity, BMI, physical activity, smoking status, alcohol intake, waist
circumference, type 2 diabetes and liver diseases (cholelithiasis,
cholecystectomy and alcoholic liver disease).

**Secondary analyses**

Causal mediation analysis will be used for hypothesis 2 and applied to
all three levels of adjustment as in the main analyses, so that
potential mediator-outcome confounding can be taken into account \[13\].
To evaluate the pooling of the outcome data, a stratified analysis of
the liver cancer subtypes, HCC and IH-CCA, will be conducted. The
association of legume intake and liver cancer risk will be estimated
using quintiles of legume intake (g/day) and modelled as in model 2.

All analyses will be conducted in R with a significance level of 5%.

## Transformations

::: content-hidden
Describe any transformations you will make to the data, such as
centering, recoding, etc. This will likely change during the actual
analysis, but at least here you can give a general idea for what you
will do to the data.
:::

## Inference criteria

::: content-hidden
Describe how you will infer that a result is meaningful or not. For
instance, if using p-values, indicate what the threshold is and WHY.
Also what steps you are taking to minimize misclassification/false
discovery rate.
:::

## Data exclusion

::: content-hidden
Describe what data you will exclude and why. For instance, dropping type
1 diabetes since you are only looking at type 2 diabetes. Or how you
will handle outliers.
:::

## Missing data

::: content-hidden
Describe how you will handle missing or incomplete data. This will
likely change when you actually do your analysis, but its a good first
step.
:::

## Exploratory analyses (optional)

::: content-hidden
Describe any exploratory analyses you will do and that you might report
on/include in the manuscript. Exploratory analysis is on where you have
not made a hypothesis or prediction about, and instead are seeing what
patterns or associations might exist. This could be to help you in your
main analysis or it could be the main aim of your project.
:::

**Other analyses**

To test for effect modification, stratified analyses will be conducted
based on sex (male, female), waist circumference (above or below 94 cm
for men, 80 cm for women), type 2 diabetes, and other liver diseases
(yes, no).

Sensitivity analyses will be conducted to test the robustness of main
analyses. These will include changes in exposure in the substitution
model, e.g. 50 grams of legumes for red meat and substitution of 10
grams/day per 1000 kcal of legume protein with protein from red meat.
Further sensitivity analyses will include imputations of missing
information, inclusion of varying numbers of completed diet
questionnaires, and removal of individuals highly predisposed to liver
cancer, e.g. primary biliary cirrhosis, alcoholic liver disease, and
viral hepatitis. All sensitivity analyses will be modelled as in the
main analysis.
